    "title": "\"Mountain Child\" (2017)",
    "description": "\"Mountain Child\" is a short story about a tiny mountain spirit who wants to become a human boy. It's quite simple but I enjoyed the planning and drawing process. This is one of the first comics I've ever finished, so the narrative still holds a special place in my heart. ",
