    "description": "Homecooked is a turn-based narrative RPG, all about cooking! Check out the game development page here! In the illustrations done below, I was asked to draw using a crayon and pastel style inspired by children's books and the artwork of Louie Zong. I had free reign to draw any subjects I wanted, so I focused on environments and character designs.",
